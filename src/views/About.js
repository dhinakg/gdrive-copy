      <p>
        This app provides the capability to copy a Google Drive folder. It will
        copy all contents of the folder and preserve the internal structure of
        the files and folders. Optionally, you can also copy any sharing
        permissions over to the new folder.
      </p>

      <p>
        If a folder is nested within other folders of your Google Drive, it is
        often convenient to make a new copy in the same location. This is the
        default behavior. However, if you would rather have the copy appear at
        the top level of your Google Drive, you can select to place your copy at
        the Root level.

        This app is built and maintained for free by one person, and is in no
        way affiliated with or supported by Google (other than hosting, which
        they provide for free). While reporting issues is appreciated, please be
        aware that the developer's time is limited, and this product does not

        This app has been modified to allow for local usage hosted on the drive
        owned by Recrut AS, and not through some web app of an unknown developer
        (who would in essence act as a data processor if we use the app to move
        personal data, which we do NOT want).<br />
        Modifications that allow for template folders to be generated with pre-
        filled content e.g. for sales purposes could be a possible extension of
        this service. Reach out to the Recrut developer team if you or your team
        find youselves in need of this.
