      <div>
        When the app stops, you can use the "Resume" button to restart the
        copying. When selecting the folder to resume, you must select the{' '}
        <b>in-progress</b> folder, <b>not</b> the original.<br />
        <br />
        For example, if you are creating a copy of "Folder A" called "Copy of
        Folder A", you should select "Copy of Folder A" when you resume the
        copying. Selecting the original folder will return an error.

        Yes! Follow the steps below:
        <ol>
          <li>Log into the account that owns the folder ("Account 1")</li>
          <li>
            Share the folder with the domain to which you'd like to copy
            ("Account 2")
          </li>
          <li>Open an private/incognito window and log into Account 2</li>
          <li>
            Go to the "Shared with me" section, right click the folder, and
            select "Add to Drive"
          </li>
          <li>Open the app, and select the folder that has been shared</li>
          <li>Create a copy and Account 2 will now be the owner</li>

        You will know it is complete when the Copy Log says "Complete" in cell
        C2. In addition, the cell will highlight green.

      </h3>
      <div>
        Typically this is due to server errors encountered while copying. You
        should be able to do one of the following to resolve this situation:
        <ol>
          <li>
            Audit the Copy Log for any errors, and manually copy those files
          </li>
          <li>
            Restart the copy process. Typically, it is best if you wait a few
            hours if you ran into significant copying errors
          </li>

        <a name="multipleAccounts" />How do I sign into a different account with
        this app?
      </h3>
      <div>
        There isn't a handy Account Switcher like you'll find in native Google
        Apps.* However, you can try to use the link at the top of the page which
        should re-direct you and allow you to sign if from a different account.<br
        />
        <br />
        If that fails, I would recommend signing in from another browser, or
        opening an incognito/private window and accessing the app that way.

        Currently, this app is not able to auto-generate folders e.g. for
        for sales teams when new leads are generated. However, this would
        probably not require too much modification so reach out to the Recrut
        development team if you find yourself in need of such a service.<br />
        Likewise, if you have other requests for extensions to this service that
        will make you more productive, reach out to the Recrut development team
        to see if they can help you.
